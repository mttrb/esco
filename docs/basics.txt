Structure:
Every brainfuck-like machine (script executor) contains from next units:
- machine (class BFMachine for brainfuck);
- memory (class BFMemmory for braifuck);
- user interaction classes to input and output data (EnvTouch classes);
- Source - class which one create list of tied commands.

All this units deliver to creator. For BF and BF-like languages - MachineCreater (sorry for mistake).
MachineCreater returns machine type class which one is used to execute program step by step.

Source:
This class is used to transfer program source in esco' internal format.
Program transfers by preprocessor classes. This classes called *PreProcessor (OokPreProcessor for Ook! language).
PreProcessor used one of SourceReader classes to read source (FileReader - reads source from file);

Finally to create machine you mast:
Create SourceReader class with necessary method of reading;
Create PreProcessor class for language;
Create MachineCreater.
MachineCreater->create() to get ready for action machine.

Best regards.
